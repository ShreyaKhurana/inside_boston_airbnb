Our dataset comes from Aribnb website, which describes the listing activity of Housing data in Boston, MA. It includes three parts, Listings, Reviews and Calendar. We mainly use Listings for our analysis and Reviews for visualisation.

The objective is to explore the data and study the relationship between the price and other features shown in the dataset.
The dataset Listings contains some of the following important variables:

1. Host attributes: Host response time, Host acceptance rate, superhost or not, host identity verified or not, ways that host has been verified (like email, Facebook etc.)

2. Listing Attributes: Price per night, price per month, Neighbourhood, property type (house, apartment etc.), room type (like private room or entire home being rented out), number of beds, number of bathrooms, cancellation policy, the amenities available in the listing (TV, AC, washer-dryer etc.), availability in a given time frame (30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 1 year)

3. Reviews for Listings: Average ratings of listings on various parameters like cleanliness, communication,
check-in, location and value

Our first step was data cleaning since the raw data was not fit for modeling. Based on the cleaned data, our next step was exploratory and graphical analysis. We discovered some interesting visualizations and results of descriptive features and the relationship between them. We also answered some interesting questions based on ANOVA. In our last step, we modeled the price based on all the desciptive features using multiple linear regression.
